    This is a project that placed 3rd in UC Merced's 2019 Local Hack Day. The project was originally written in <mark>Flutter</mark> but due to the time limit, my partner and I decided to rewrite the code onto an web app. I primarly focused on the front-end of the page using <mark>HTML5</mark> and <mark>Bootstrap4</mark>
