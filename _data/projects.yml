    This is a project that placed 3rd in UC Merced's 2019 Local Hack Day. The project was originally written in <mode>Flutter</mode> but due to the time limit, my partner and I decided to rewrite the code onto an web app. I primarly focused on the front-end of the page using <mode>HTML5</mode> and <mode>Bootstrap4</mode>
